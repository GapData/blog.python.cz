About: [Honza](http://honzajavorek.cz) is a software engineer. Since 2011 he helps to develop the [Czech Python user group](http://python.cz/). In [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) works as a maintainer of [Dredd](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd), an Open Source tool for testing web APIs.


In June this year we held the [third annual PyCon in the Czech Republic](https://cz.pycon.org/2017/), for the first time held in Prague. We’d like to take this opportunity to wrap-up the 2017 conference so we can kick things off for 2018 planning!

First off, while the 2017 conference was a lot of work for all the volunteer organizers, it was a ton of fun to organize as well! Over the three conference event days we had:

TODO read https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9LUg0ZhacR7eVIyX2RMbTdsMTA and add some stats

- about X visitors
- X keynote speeches
- X talks and X workshops on different subjects
- X individual speakers
- X lightning talks
- X sponsors and event partners
- X Slunicko shoutout
- Xkg of coffee/tea served
-->

Not to mention all the incredible community networking that took place during the event!

## Videos & Photos

This was the first time we managed to have a live streaming from the event. The stream covered both days of the conference talks and both rooms. Thanks to the fact the Q&A was driven by [Slido](https://www.sli.do/), not only people in the rooms, but also anyone watching the stream could ask questions. The stream recordings are still available on YouTube:

- [Theatre Room, Thu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=170uRdCLUPY)
- [Main Room, Thu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAwbeQqN4dI)
- [Theatre Room, Fri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Azpwf2LRK0)
- [Main Room, Fri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=motIB96FI48)

Special thanks go to [Peter Hozák](http://peter.hozak.info/), who voluntarily posted a comment with time anchors under each of the videos, so soon after the conference anyone could easily scan the recordings to watch what they like.

Post-processed videos of individual talks are [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyde45Tox-NczAxZ7L7_YF9sxOgby8zHR) as well. Each [talk page](https://cz.pycon.org/2017/speakers/talks/) was updated with the video embedded right under the talk description.

Official selection of photos from the event is [available on Google Photos](https://goo.gl/photos/agrkCMUQksNKqsGG7).

## Community organizations

The core organizing team had grand expectations for this year’s event and it’s incredible to look back at all the things we have accomplished together. Not only did we completely rebrand PyCon CZ this year, we launched an entirely new and [reusable Django based website](https://github.com/pyvec/cz.pycon.org-2016), a mobile app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pycon-cz-2016/id1166720746), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.pycon.pyconcz)) and so much more!

With that said, we’d like to take a moment to thank everyone involved – all the CfP submission authors, the invited and accepted speakers, the sponsors, the fine folks at [Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/.en) who provided the venue space, the [Czech Python community](https://python.cz) in general and all the attendees who joined us to make PyCon CZ the amazing event it was.

While we’re at it, we’d like to call out two special groups which could use your help – participation as well as sponsorships; groups whose ongoing work enabled this conference and will hopefully enable others like it in the future:

- [Pyvec](http://pyvec.org/) – the formal backers of the PyCon CZ events and so many other Python events in the Czech Republic, whose continuous activity and monthly [Pyvo meetups](https://pyvo.cz/) are the lifeblood of the [Czech Python community](https://python.cz/), and
- the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). They are the good people who take care of the ongoing development of the Python language and the global activities around it. The PSF sponsored PyCon CZ 2016, as it does many such events.

## Diversity

We've put effort into making the conference as welcoming as possible. We had [Code of Conduct](https://cz.pycon.org/2017/about/code/) in place and we were reaching out to specific communities, which are usually underrepresented in technical conferences.

This year, Czech PyLadies were heavily involved in the organization team and many others attended the conference as well. After moving the conference from Brno to Prague, the Prague PyLadies beginners course alumni [Bára Drbohlavová](https://twitter.com/BaraDrb) volunteered to become the chair of the conference. The [PyLadies of Prague, Brno and Ostrava](http://pyladies.cz/) were invited to participate with a discount equal to student ticket fare.

[Zuzka Válková](https://github.com/zuzejk), long time Prague PyLadies beginners course organizer, joined our team to hold the [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) workshop together with the conference. All Django Girls participants had free entrance to the conference.

Vojtěch Polášek, author of the [Blind attendee about PyCon CZ 2016](http://blog.python.cz/blind-attendee-about-pycon-cz-2016) blog post, came to the conference also this year.

### Statistics

- More than 30% of the talks were not given by men, although the selection process did not take gender into consideration.
- More than ⅕ of the audience were women.

In past years the Czech Python community made a big leap towards attracting women into tech. We think the attendance of women at PyCon CZ is significantly influenced by the day-to-day work of all who put the effort, primarily all people around the activites of [PyLadies](http://pyladies.cz/). We hope to become an inspiration for other Czech tech communities and events.

### What could have been done

- Given the context we're a developer-focused conference in the Czech Republic, ⅕ of audience a good number, but in the following years we would like to find and remove as much remaining obstacles for women to attend as possible and to achieve even higher numbers. Experience from abroad shows there's still a margin.
- [Because of last minute changes of the venue](http://blog.python.cz/pycon-cz-2017-changes-date-and-venue), both of the main conference days happened during working days. According to reports, such choice isn't exactly the best for attracting beginners.
- For the same reason the Django Girls workshop had to be on Sunday, after the whole conference. That's why many attendees of the workshop did not come to the conference, although they were given a free ticket.
- We did not manage to pursue more partnerships. E.g. last year we invited [VODICÍ PES](www.vycvikvodicichpsu.cz).

## Code of Conduct Report

The organization team agrees that all PyCon events should be accessible and welcoming to everyone, regardless of their background. We agree that a clear and specific Code of Conduct is a necessity for any event.

- The [Code of Conduct](https://cz.pycon.org/2017/about/code/) was based on Conference anti-harassment policy from [Geek feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) and edited to be as specific to our event as possible
- Agreeing to the Code was mandatory when buying a ticket
- Two contact persons (male and female) were assigned
- Attendees were reminded of the Code in the opening speech of each day

### What could have been done

- Summary of the Code in both languages were not posted around the venue
- Phone numbers of the contact persons were not posted around the venue
- There was no easy way to report an incident other than to write an e-mail or to talk to the CoC contact person
- Czech language version of the Code was not accessible on the website

## Budget

In the spirit of Open Source and transparency, we’re happy to share a summary of our budget (all numbers are thousands of Czech Koruna, CZK).

### Income

- Sponsorship: 648
- Ticket sales: 400
- **Total: 1048**

### Expenses

- Venue: 215
- Catering: 187
- Robot workshop: 9
- Conference party (food+drinks): 41
- Financial aid (incl. keynote speakers): 130
- Photo/Video recording & editing: 97
- Swag, lanyards: 29
- On-site fun (DJ, games): 21
- Stationery, roll-ups: 18
- Various other: 10
- **Total: 757**

### Conclusion

As you can see, we ended with a positive balance of close to 291 000 CZK. That's because the conference moved from Brno to Prague and the organization team also changed, so we were very deffensive about our estimates and spending. All the surplus funds will be applied to next year’s event budget.

## 2018

Now, onto planning PyCon CZ 2018. For the next year, the conference stays in Prague. Neither the time should change, so count with early summer. You can join the organizing team, or just keep track of our progress via our different channels:
